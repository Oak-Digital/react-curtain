# react-curtain

React curtain can be used as a page transition, by hiding all your content behind a curtain and then switching out the components.
React curtain will not switch out it's children while transitioning, thus reducing complexity in your application.

## Getting started

```
# pnpm, npm or yarn
pnpm install @oak-digital/react-curtain framer-motion
```
